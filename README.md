# NTH & Associates internship
Hello! Thanks for checking out the code that I did for my internship!
This code was used to analyze pressure gauge data that I received from my employer.
internship.py was the one I used to get the minimums and maximums and generate a report.
ErrorAnalysis.py was used to analyze those reports and find the errors.
